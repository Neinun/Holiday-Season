Repo of all the files from my project on the Holiday Season Deep learning challenge and Android Application incorporating the deep learning model as well.
Problem Link : https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/hackerearth-deep-learning-challenge-holidays/

The Team1_report.pdf has the final report of the project where we explain the preprocessing and the model made that went into this project.<br>
The ipynb has the code that makes the model. We have made use of transfer learning and employed the inception-V3 architechture. <br>
Our self made CNN had low accuracy and transfer learning models perform well on deep learning challenges.
The App_info.txt has link to the fina app that you can download and check the results for yourself.
