This links to the apk that has the model incorporated. The file is bigger than 25 mb so i have not uploaded it here. A more optimized app can be made using the mobilenet architechture 
which would reduce the model size and thus the app to about 10-20 mb. I am not pursuing that as of now.
App can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qb18njTgMwpouSzZOwOz9cKjUC4moq5O/view?usp=sharing).
